**PRIME-DDOS PUBLIC V5**

**What is DDoS?**

A DDoS attack, which stands for Distributed Denial of Service, is a type of cyberattack that aims to make a website, server, or online service unavailable by overwhelming it with too much traffic. Instead of using just one computer, attackers control thousands—or even millions—of devices, often called a botnet. These devices send a massive flood of requests to the target all at once.

Because the system can’t handle the sudden overload, it slows down, crashes, or completely shuts out real users. Think of it like a highway jammed with fake cars: the road is so crowded that actual drivers can’t move forward.

There are different forms of DDoS attacks. Some focus on flooding a network with data, some exploit weaknesses in internet protocols, and others target specific applications. Regardless of the method, the main goal is always the same—to disrupt normal operations and cause downtime.

DDoS attacks are common today because they are relatively easy to launch but can have serious consequences. They can take down popular websites, interrupt online services, and cause major inconvenience to businesses and users.
